1. Differences between stateless and stateful components: 
- Stateful Component: Can be both Class-based and Functional 
components. Stateful components are components that manage state

- Stateless Components: is the Functional Component that doesn't 
manage state

2. Differences between Class-based and Functional components: 

- Class-based Component: 
+, Components that having a Class that extends the Components object
+, Use Lifecycle Hooks
+, Access State and Props via "this" keyword
+, Use class-based if you need to manage State or access to 
Lifecycle Hooks and you dont want to use React Hooks

- Functional Component: 
+, Components that have a Function that is passed prop in
+, Have access to Hooks but doesn't have Lifecycle Hooks
+, Access Props via "Props"
+, Use in all other Cases

3. Creating Component Lifecycle: 
- Component Lifecycle is only available in Class-based
Component. There are Different methods running in the 
background when a components got created
- See the order of these components in Lifecycle.pdf

What does each methods do: 
- constructor(): run when a component is created. 
Can do basic initialization
- getDerivedStateFromProps(): hooks to use to update the 
state. Don't send request here
- render(): render the JSX code, Don't send request here
- Render Child Component: self explained 
- componentDidMount(): can make request here to get response. 
Can do async code here

See the use of this function in App.js, 
Hit the button, watch the console log to see the output

4. Update Component Lifecycle: 
- getDerivedStateFromProps(): used for updating state and initialize 
props. Dont send requests
- shouldComponentUpdate(nextProp, nextState): Cancel the updating process
, cancel unneccessary updates. Dont send requests here
- render(): construct the JSX
- Update Child Component Props
- getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState): takes previous props 
and states, return an object of props and object to perform Last-minute
DOM operations. Dont send requests here
- componentDidUpdate(): Signal the completion of updating. Can send 
request here. Dont update state here
